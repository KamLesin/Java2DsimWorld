This is Simple 2D virtual world simulator.
The game is representation of collotions, actions and moves made by different entities which have 
strengths and health (specified inside their classes).
To add a new entity of specific type, player should chose one from buttons list and then press on the board,
where they would like to place chosen entity.
If human is on the board it can be moved by a player using arrows. Rest of entites(animals) move randomly accordingly
to their class specification.
Plants do not move, they randomly spread.
NEXT TURN - makes next turn (entites make their moves, iteractions, collisions)
SAVE - saves current game state
LOAD - loads game state file (player has to chose the file, it should be one of the files saved previously)
M button - starts magical potion (gives human +5 strength for 1 turn (delay of 5 turns))
